# Installation & Program Running Instructions
## How To Install
* After installing all the required prerequisite, this project can be Cloned using this command: 
```python
git clone https://github.com/Shidhin-VP/StockPrice-AIAgent_StreamingResponse.git
```
* After cloning the Infrastructures for the backend can be deleted or activated from the Terraform Code from path:
```python
src/terraform/main.tf
```
* After confirming the Backend Infrastructure, follow these commands:
     * ```
       terraform init
       ```
     * ```
